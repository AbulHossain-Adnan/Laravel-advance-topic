Queue Inplement:
----------------
where is queue in laravel ,its depends on which driver you use.now we are going to use simple database driver
 from app/config/queue.php.


first_step:
-----------

Database:

In order to use the database queue driver, you will need a database table to hold the jobs. To generate a migration that creates this table, run the queue:table Artisan command. Once the migration has been created, you may migrate your database using the migrate command:

php artisan queue:table
-----------------------------

php artisan migrate
-----------------------------

Finally, don't forget to instruct your application to use the database driver by updating the QUEUE_CONNECTION variable in your application's .env file:

QUEUE_CONNECTION=database




-----------
1:we can use database driver in env file  QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

or we can simple use in queue.php like bellow,
 'default' => env('QUEUE_CONNECTION', 'database'),



Second Step:
------------
Change the notification class



use this above in notification class,
----------------------------------------------
   use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
------------------------------------------------
use this implements ShouldQueue like this. (class UserApprovalnotification extends Notification implements ShouldQueue)

yea very simple ,thats it.
